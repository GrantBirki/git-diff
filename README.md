# pr-diff ðŸ§­

A GitHub Action for gathering the `git diff` of a pull request in JSON format

## About ðŸ’¡

A useful Action for grabbing the `git diff` output of a pull request in a machine readable JSON format. This Action can be used in conjunction with other Actions or tools to perform tasks such as:

- Auditing the changes made in a pull request
- Running subsequent workflows conditionally based on the files, lines, or directories changed in a pull request
- Send out a signal to reviewers when certain files or even specific lines are changed in a pull request
