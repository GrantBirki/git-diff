# git-diff-action üìÉ

A GitHub Action for gathering the `git diff` of a pull request in JSON format or standard `git diff` format

## About üí°

A useful Action for grabbing the `git diff` output of a pull request in a machine readable JSON format. This Action can be used in conjunction with other Actions or tools to perform tasks such as:

- Auditing the changes made in a pull request
- Running subsequent workflows conditionally based on the files, lines, or directories changed in a pull request
- Send out a signal to reviewers when certain files or even specific lines are changed in a pull request

## Turbo Quickstart ‚ö°

Checkout the example below to see how you can use this Action in your workflow to get the `git diff` of changes made in the context of a pull request

> All references to `vX.X.X` are places holders and you can find the latest version of this Action under the [Releases](https://github.com/GrantBirki/git-diff/releases) section

```yaml
      # Checkout the repo
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3.0.2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0 # needed to checkout all branches for this Action to work

      # Check the PR diff using the current branch and the base branch of the PR
      - uses: GrantBirki/git-diff-action@vX.X.X
        id: git-diff-action

      # Print the diff in JSON format
      - name: echo json diff
        env:
          DIFF: ${{ steps.git-diff-action.outputs.json-diff }}
        run: echo $DIFF

      # Print the diff in raw git format
      - name: echo raw diff
        env:
          DIFF: ${{ steps.git-diff-action.outputs.raw-diff }}
        run: echo $DIFF
```
